# AMARANTH
AMARANTH is a testing framework that evaluates high-TRL AI models for the electric sector under normal and adversarial conditions. Using accelerated simulations and statistical metrics (e.g., KL divergence, PSI, RMSE), it quantifies model drift, resilience, and time-to-failure prior to deployment.
